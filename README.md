I am a Ph.D. student in School of Electrical and Computer Engineering at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/), supervised by [Prof. Y. Charlie Hu](https://engineering.purdue.edu/~ychu/). I am interested in Mobile Systems, Edge Computing, and their intersection with Machine Learning. My current research focuses on understanding and improving the performance of ML-powered AR systems. I received my B.E. in Computer Science and Technology from [University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) in 2018.
